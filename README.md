# Networks 2 - Project

Here we will explain how to run our program in Intellij and Eclipse.

## Intellij
Firstly open the project.<br/>
![Capture 1](./images/Capture1.PNG)<br/>
Open -> Select project -> ok<br/>

After you should se that a compound has been already set.<br/>
![Capture 2](./images/Capture2.PNG)<br/>

If you want to check what that compound contains you can click on:<br/>
Project (run part) -> Edit Configurations...<br/>
![Capture 4](./images/Capture4.PNG)<br/>
![Capture 3](./images/Capture3.PNG)<br/>

Why did we use a compound?<br/>
Since we have just 1 code for the servers, we need to execute it multiple times. So that our implementation works right you need to execute 10 times the Server.class and 1 time the Client.class.<br/>

## Eclipse
